# hutte-flxbl

## Introduction

_Note that Flxbl is the new brand for DX@Scale (more on [DX@Scale Becomes Flxbl](https://medium.com/flxbl/dx-scale-becomes-flxbl-%CB%88fleks%C9%99b-%C9%99-l-why-a9b12eb0f79b))_

This Hutte recipe joins the best of the worlds of Flxbl (formerly DX@Scale) and Hutte.

To showcase the combination of Hutte and Flxbl the [Easy-Spaces-LWC](https://github.com/trailheadapps/easy-spaces-lwc) application is added to this repository, which follows a modular archictecture.

## Fine-tuning of Hutte and Flxbl

This repository has been adapted accordingly taking into accounts the next facs:

1. Hutte Scratch org/Sandbox creation functionality replaces Flxbl scratch org/sandbox creation
2. Hutte Scratch org/Sandbox Pools replaces Flxbl Pools
3. Github Actions are using Hutte Pool orgs for Pull Request Validations
4. [Hutte.yml](./hutte.yml) is configured to automatically perform packages (metadata and data) provisioning to the created scratch org, besides installing the [sfpowerscripts](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts-artifact) unlocked package.

## Commit Data, not only metadata

A hutte custom button has been created in order to update a Flxbl data package on user-demand

This custom button will:

1. Commit data changes to the git branch
2. When the Pull Request is merged, a Github action will automatically run and:
   1. Create a new Flxbl data package (specified in the [sfdx-project.json](./sfdx-project.json))
   2. Publish it as an Package in the Github Repository
3. When a new scratch/sandbox org is created, the configured script in [Hutte.yml](hutte.yml) will deploy the new data package to the recently created org and therefore having the data seed happening automatically.

### An example by images

1. Let's say that **accounts are created in a Scratch Org**

2. **These account records can be then committed using the `Commit Data` custom button**

<img src="./docs/images/data-and-metadata-changes-1.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

3. After that, a Pull Request can be created from Hutte, and the created **Pull Request will automatically validate the updated data package against the next org**

<img src="./docs/images/data-and-metadata-changes-2.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

4. **Finally, when the Pull Request is merged, a new data package will be published. This new data package will be provisioned to any new scratch org**, as configured in [Hutte.yml](./hutte.yml).

## ALM Automations

- **Build, publish and deploy packages publish on Merge of Pull Request. Deployment is automatically performed to SIT and UAT**

## Summary

This repository contains the following YAML based Github Pipeline defintions

- validate.yml

Pull Request Validation Pipeline, that validates incoming changes against a scratch org fetched from the Hutte pool

- build-publish-deploy.yml

Pipeline that gets triggered on a merge to the trunk (main), resulting in building a set of packages, publishing these to the artifact repository and finally deploying them to the SIT and UAT salesforce orgs.

- release.yml

A release pipeline that utilizes the release definition to fetch artifacts from artifactory and then deploy to a sandbox.

- release-build-publish.yml

Triggered on a merge to a release/x branch. Assumes a change has been created/tested in main/dev and needs to be included in the release via a cherry-pick to the release branch. This builds and publishes off the relase branch making it available for the release pipeline.

### Github Secrets

- HUTTE_API_TOKEN (Can be found in the profile settings of the Hutte user)
- DEVHUB_SFDX_AUTH_URL
- SIT_SFDX_AUTH_URL
- UAT_SFDX_AUTH_URL

Optionally, if you use a platform like Splunk, Datadog, or New Relic, configure the environment variables accordinly for `sfp` to send the metrics to these. Below is the environment variable name that `sfp` will expect. These will also require to be specified in the github action workflows (currently are there as placeholder commented).

- SFPOWERSCRIPTS_NEWRELIC
- SFPOWERSCRIPTS_NEWRELIC_API_KEY
- SFPOWERSCRIPTS_DATADOG
- SFPOWERSCRIPTS_DATADOG_HOST
- SFPOWERSCRIPTS_DATADOG_API_KEY
- SFPOWERSCRIPTS_SPLUNK
- SFPOWERSCRIPTS_SPLUNK_HOST
- SFPOWERSCRIPTS_SPLUNK_API_KEY

### Github Vars

## Setup

1. Create a repository from this template using the Github `Use this template` button
2. Set the Github Secrets listed above
3. Create a Hutte project, and link it to the DevHub and the recently created repository
4. At this point, it's ready to be tested with the [Easy-Spaces-LWC](https://github.com/trailheadapps/easy-spaces-lwc) application. You may perform some mock changes and follow the standard development flow to play with it and get a better understanding
5. You may continue next steps by creating an action plan on how to migrate your salesforce application to use this framework combining the power of Hutte and Flxbl
